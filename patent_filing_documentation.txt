**Title of Invention:** A HYBRID, MULTI-MODULE SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR AI-POWERED IDEA GENERATION, EVALUATION, AND RECOMMENDATION

**Abstract:**

A system and method for generating, evaluating, and recommending ideas, comprising a multi-module architecture that integrates large language models (LLMs), causal reasoning, economic feasibility analysis, and a blockchain-based integrity layer. The system receives a natural language prompt, generates a plurality of ideas, and enriches them with a wide range of features, including sentiment, market trends, and ESG scores. A hybrid ranking algorithm, enhanced with causal impact and economic viability, scores the ideas, and a blockchain ledger ensures their provenance and integrity. The system provides a ranked list of recommendations with detailed explanations, visualizations, and a verifiable, tamper-proof history.

**Background of the Invention:**

The present invention relates to the field of recommendation systems, and more specifically to a system and method for generating and evaluating complex, high-value ideas, such as startup concepts, research projects, or marketing campaigns.

Traditional recommendation systems are typically designed for well-structured domains like e-commerce or media streaming, where they recommend existing items based on user preferences and item attributes. These systems are often limited in their ability to handle the ambiguity and complexity of novel ideas, which are not predefined and require a deeper level of analysis. Furthermore, existing systems lack the mechanisms to ensure the integrity and provenance of the ideas they generate, which is a critical requirement in intellectual property-sensitive applications.

Therefore, there is a need for a more advanced system that can not only generate novel ideas but also evaluate them from a multi-faceted perspective, incorporating factors like economic feasibility, causal impact, and ethical considerations, while also providing a secure, verifiable record of their origin and evolution.

**Summary of the Invention:**

The present invention provides a system and method for AI-powered idea generation, evaluation, and recommendation that overcomes the limitations of traditional recommendation systems. The invention comprises a multi-module architecture with 28 integrated components that work in concert to provide a holistic analysis of novel ideas.

In one aspect of the invention, a large language model is used to generate a plurality of ideas from a natural language prompt. These ideas are then passed through a pre-processing pipeline that includes an ethics filter and a duplicate check.

In another aspect of the invention, a rich set of features are extracted for each idea, including sentiment, market trends, ESG scores, and embeddings. A unique hybrid ranking algorithm then calculates a score for each idea based on a weighted combination of 9 components, including an Elo rating, a Bayesian mean, a causal impact score, and a web scraping score that provides real-world context.

In yet another aspect of the invention, a blockchain-based integrity layer creates a tamper-proof ledger of all ideas and their evolution, ensuring their provenance and providing a verifiable audit trail.

The system outputs a ranked list of recommendations with detailed explanations, visualizations, and a verifiable history, providing a powerful tool for innovation and decision-making.

**Detailed Description of the Invention:**

The present invention is a hybrid, multi-module system and method for AI-powered idea generation, evaluation, and recommendation. The system is comprised of 28 integrated modules, which can be broadly categorized into the following layers:

1.  **Idea Generation Layer:** This layer is responsible for generating a plurality of ideas from a natural language prompt provided by the user. It utilizes a large language model (LLM), such as `llama3.2:1b` or `mistral:7b`, to generate creative and relevant ideas.

2.  **Pre-processing Layer:** Once ideas are generated, they are passed through a pre-processing layer that includes an ethics filter to flag and block potentially harmful or unethical content, and a duplicate check to prevent redundant ideas from entering the system.

3.  **Feature Extraction Layer:** This layer enriches each idea with a wide range of features, including:
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** The emotional tone of the idea's description is analyzed to produce a sentiment score.
    *   **Market Trend Analysis:** The system analyzes the idea's description and tags to determine its relevance to current market trends.
    *   **ESG Scoring:** The idea is scored on its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) impact.
    *   **Embeddings:** A sentence-transformer model is used to generate a vector embedding of the idea's description, which is used for similarity searches.
    *   **Web Scraping:** A web scraper, powered by the Gemini API, searches the web for the idea's title to provide real-world context, a summary of the competitive landscape, and a novelty score.

4.  **Storage Layer:** The system utilizes a multi-faceted storage layer to persist and manage the ideas:
    *   **SQLite Database:** The main data for each idea, including its title, description, features, and scores, is stored in an SQLite database.
    *   **Blockchain Ledger:** A blockchain-based integrity layer creates a tamper-proof ledger of all ideas and their evolution. A SHA-256 hash of each idea is stored in a block, which is then chained to the previous block, creating an immutable record of the idea's provenance.
    *   **Temporal Memory Database:** The vector embeddings of the ideas are stored in a separate database, which allows for tracking the evolution of ideas over time.

5.  **Ranking and Recommendation Layer:** This is the core of the invention, where ideas are scored and ranked. The ranking algorithm is a hybrid model that combines 10 weighted components:
    *   **Elo Rating:** A rating system that is updated based on user feedback.
    *   **Bayesian Mean:** A statistical measure that represents the idea's expected quality.
    *   **Uncertainty:** A measure of the confidence in the Bayesian mean.
    *   **Sentiment Score:** The sentiment of the idea's description.
    *   **Provenance Score:** A score that reflects the trustworthiness of the idea's source.
    *   **Freshness:** A score that is higher for newer ideas.
    *   **Trend Score:** The idea's relevance to current market trends.
    *   **Causal Impact:** A score that is derived from a lightweight causal reasoning model that identifies the causal drivers of success.
    *   **Serendipity:** A score that is higher for ideas that are dissimilar to the user's query but are still relevant.
    *   **Web Score:** The novelty score returned by the web scraper.

The final score is then enhanced with adjustments for ethics and economic feasibility. The **economic feasibility** is determined by a model that analyzes the idea's ROI and risk, using a Pareto optimization to balance the two.

6.  **Output Layer:** The system outputs a ranked list of recommendations with detailed explanations and visualizations. The explanations include a breakdown of the scoring components, and the visualizations provide a rich, multi-faceted view of the results.
